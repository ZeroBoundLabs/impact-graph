# Impact Graph

## This project has been taken over by Giveth. You can see the latest version of the [impact graph here](https://github.com/Giveth/impact-graph)

ImpactQL is a GraphQL server, that enables rapid development of serverless impact project applications. It does this by taking care of the persistance of impact project data.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:topiahq/impact-graph.git
cd impact-graph
npm i
cp config/example.env config/development.env
```

Edit the config/development.env file in your favorite code editor and the environmental variables

[Create a database](https://medium.com/coding-blocks/creating-user-database-and-adding-access-on-postgresql-8bfcd2f4a91e) (we recommend Postgres) on your computer or server, we currently support for for MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, MongoDB and SQLite).

If you don't have redis installed do so, and then start it with:

```
redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf
```

That's it

## Features

### Authentication

### Start fast

We enable impact projects to use our installation securely and privately for free, reach out for more details

### Own your own data

If this is more important you and your have the resources, deploy your own version of this

- An open source solution that enables you to keep control of your data
- Supports Bring Your Own Database (BYOD) and can be used with any database
- Built-in support for MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, MongoDB and SQLite
- Works great with databases from popular hosting providers

## Architecture

The aim is to give a single entry point into any persistance solution that you want to use for your data.
The aim is for something like this:
![Impact Graph architecture](/docs/img/impact-graph.png)

We have so far only implemented these databases - MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, MongoDB and SQLite

## Roadmap

The first usecase we are building is user registration and putting projects in the database

## Authentication

### Strategies

There are many strategies available for authentication

#### Email address and password

```javascript
mutation RegisterUser {
  mutation {
    register(
      data: {
        email: "testemail@email.com"
        password: "thisisatestpassword"
        firstName: "Bob"
        lastName: "Barker"
      }
    ) {
      id
      email
    }
  }
}

mutation {
  login(email: "testemail@email.com", password: "thisisatestpassword") {
    token
    user {
      firstName
      lastName
      email
    }
  }
}
```

#### Ethereum wallet

```javascript
mutation {
  loginWallet(walletAddress:"0xeC54C676E54c5e3e7F095D979eA13533b5dC2177", signature: "0x417f84a0d31abf872a8071da3e888a5708dfff76f4fcb9c07dde1a36a0e8241a6b8f3480a936efe661772cc6d8156504acec6789cc5246c363f0634b9ee956601b", email: "testemail@email.com") {
    token
    user {

      email
    }
  }
}
```

#### OAuth

- Designed to work with any OAuth service, it supports OAuth 1.0, 1.0A and 2.0
- Built-in support for many popular OAuth sign-in services

#### Supports both JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

- Supports both JSON Web Tokens

### Example queries

```javascript
query GetProjects {
  projects {
    title
    id
    description
  }
}

query AppProject {
  mutation {
    addProject(
      project: {
        title: "Unicorn DAC"
        description: "The Unicorn DAC, a non-hierarchical decentralized governance experimentWhy are bosses necessary? They arent. Self-managed organizations exist all over the world, but there is no template for how a ..."
      }
    ) {
      title
      description
    }
  }
}

mutation RegisterUser {
  mutation {
    register(
      data: {
        email: "testemail@email.com"
        password: "thisisatestpassword"
        firstName: "Bob"
        lastName: "Barker"
      }
    ) {
      id
      email
    }
  }
}

mutation LoginWallet {
  mutation {
    loginWallet(
      walletAddress: "0x......................................0"
      signature: "0xaslkdjasldkfjs8afjoi3jo3urjfo3902094304832094230948p34023948203423094802384idfb"
      email: "test@testington.com"
    ) {
      token
      user {
        email
      }
    }
  }
}

```
